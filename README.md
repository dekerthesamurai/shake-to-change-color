# Shake-to-Change-Color

In this repository I have done some work with shake detection in android application

In this Project we learned about Sensors and how to access them in java ( Android Studio ) using Sensor Package. Using this Package we can access both physical and virtual sensors to get information such as position of the device and certain movements can also be tracked.
